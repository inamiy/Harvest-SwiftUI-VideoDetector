# Harvest-SwiftUI-VideoDetector

ðŸ“¹ Video image/text recognizers written in SwiftUI + Harvest + iOS Vision + SwiftyTesseract.

## Examples

| Face | Text Rect |
|---|---|
| <img src="Assets/ios-vision-face-recognition.jpg" width="750"> | <img src="Assets/ios-vision-text-rect.jpg" width="750"> |


| iOS Vision | Tesseract (Japanese) |
|---|---|
| <img src="Assets/ios-vision-text-recognition.jpg" width="750"> | <img src="Assets/tesseract-japanese.jpg" width="750"> |

### Caveats & ðŸ†˜ Need Help!

- There is a weird **codesign issue** where app can't get installed without adding `codesign --force` in Run Script as a workaround, so **try build & device-install several times** even Xcode may prompt install error.
- Text recognition works for landscape mode only (need help for portrait detection!)
- Tesseract 4.0.0 + Japanese text recognition is super slow & poor at the moment.
